I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

One day when I got up in the morning I ve noticed that I slept in.
I didnt have much time having a normal breakfast.
so I hurriedly maked mug-brownie.
